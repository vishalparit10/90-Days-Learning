Attended Terrform session from trainwithshubham.
Understood the terrform basics: 

Created AWS ServerLess Project: using Serverless Framawork using python (aws-node-http-api-project)

- Launch EC2 instance, followed documentation from serverless framework website to install it. (need npm, nvm updated versions)

- Created AIM user with administrative access and generated Access Key so we can deploy the code and further we need to do AWS credential setup for serverless.

- Easy way to do this is aws configure: followed AWS doc to install AWS cli v2
- run serverless deploy to deploy the code, once completed access the URL provided on the screen and to the website.

Created one more project using: aws-node-http-api-project
